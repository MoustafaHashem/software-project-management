\chapter[Project Constraints]{Project Time, Scope, and Cost Constraints}

\vspace{12pt}

\noindent This chapter defines the triple constraints of project management—time, scope, and cost—which form the foundation for project planning and control. These constraints are interdependent and must be carefully balanced to ensure project success.

% ============================================================================
\section{Time Constraints}

\par The project timeline is governed by academic calendar requirements and institutional needs. The following temporal constraints apply to this project:

\subsection{Project Duration}

    \item \textbf{Project Start Date:} March 1, 2026
    \item \textbf{Project Completion Date:} September 15, 2026
    \item \textbf{Production Deployment Date:} August 31, 2026 (4 weeks before registration period)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Critical Deadlines}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Requirements Finalization:} Week 3 (March 21, 2026)
    \item \textbf{Design Approval:} Week 6 (April 11, 2026)
    \item \textbf{Development Completion:} Week 16 (June 19, 2026)
    \item \textbf{Testing Completion:} Week 21 (July 24, 2026)
    \item \textbf{User Training:} Week 23 (August 7, 2026)
    \item \textbf{System Go-Live (Production Deployment):} Week 26 (August 28, 2026)
    \item \textbf{Post-Deployment Stabilization \& Support:} Weeks 27-28 (August 29 - September 15, 2026)
    \item \textbf{Project Closure:} Week 28 (September 15, 2026)
    \item \textbf{Registration Period Start:} October 1, 2026 
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Time Constraint Factors}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Registration period start date is non-negotiable and externally imposed
    \item Academic calendar dictates when the system must be operational
    \item Limited availability of stakeholders during semester breaks
    \item Peak registration periods require system to be fully functional
    \item Training must be completed before semester start
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Schedule Flexibility}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Buffer Time:} 2 weeks built into schedule for unforeseen delays
    \item \textbf{Fast-Tracking Opportunities:} Some testing activities can overlap with development
    \item \textbf{Resource Flexibility:} Additional resources can be allocated to critical path activities if needed
    \item \textbf{Non-Negotiable Deadline:} Final deployment must occur before registration period
\end{itemize}

\end{table}

\subsection{Budget Constraints and Limitations}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Target Budget:} 350,000 EGP
    \item \textbf{Maximum Budget Ceiling:} 367,500 EGP (350,000 + 5\% variance allowance)
    \item \textbf{Budget Approval:} Any expenditure exceeding 350,000 EGP requires project sponsor approval
    \item \textbf{Funding Phases:} Budget released in quarterly installments
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure:} Must utilize existing university infrastructure where possible
    \item \textbf{Procurement:} All purchases must follow university procurement policies

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Cost Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item No significant market price fluctuations for technology components
    \item University provides existing infrastructure at no additional cost
    \item Open-source software utilized where appropriate to minimize licensing costs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Budget Variance Tolerance}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Total Budget Variance:} Up to +5\% (17,500 EGP) above target budget of 350,000 EGP with sponsor approval
    \item \textbf{Category Variance:} Individual budget categories may vary by ±10\% through reallocation, provided total budget remains within approved limits
    \item \textbf{Category Reallocation:} Requires project manager approval for variances up to 10,000 EGP; sponsor approval for larger reallocations
    \item \textbf{Contingency Usage:} Requires project manager approval and must be documented with justification
    \item \textbf{Budget Overrun Prevention:} Regular monitoring and early escalation required when approaching variance thresholds
\end{itemize}

\section{Constraint Priorities and Trade-offs}

\par In case of conflicts between constraints, the following priority order applies:

\subsection{Constraint Priority Matrix}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Constraint Priorities}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{8cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Priority} & \textbf{Constraint} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\hline
1 & Time & Registration deadline is non-negotiable; missing it causes major institutional impact \\
\hline
2 & Scope & Core functionality must be delivered; system must be usable for students \\
\hline
3 & Cost & Budget has some flexibility; additional funding may be available if justified \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Trade-off Scenarios}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{If timeline is at risk:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider reducing scope (move non-critical features to Phase 2)
        \item Allocate additional resources (increase cost)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{If budget is at risk:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reduce scope to fit within budget
        \item Utilize more cost-effective resources or technologies
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{If scope must expand:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Request additional budget 
        \item Evaluate impact on quality and prioritize features
        \item Consider phased implementation approach
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

% ============================================================================
\section{Constraint Monitoring and Control}

\subsection{Performance Measurement}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Schedule Performance Index (SPI):} Monitored weekly
    \item \textbf{Cost Performance Index (CPI):} Monitored bi-weekly
    \item \textbf{Scope Completion:} Measured against WBS deliverables

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reporting Requirements}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Weekly status reports on schedule adherence
    \item Bi-weekly budget variance reports
    \item Monthly compreensive project status reports

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Interdependency of Time, Scope, and Cost}

\par The three constraints are highly interdependent:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Time constraints} limit the extent of features that can be implemented and tested
    \item \textbf{Scope constraints} ensure focus on core system functionality and prevent schedule overruns
    \item \textbf{Cost constraints} influence technology choices and limit infrastructure capabilities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Corrective Actions}

\par When constraints are at risk of being violated:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Identify root cause of variance
    \item Develop corrective action plan
    \item Assess impact on other constraints
    \item Obtain necessary approvals
    \item Implement corrections and monitor results
    \item Document lessons learned
\end{enumerate}
